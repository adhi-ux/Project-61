        <h1> About</h1>
        <div class="line-design"></div>
        <p> my favourite character is Sonic the Hedgehog because Sonic the Hedgehog is the title character and the protagonist of the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series published by Sega, as well as numerous spin-off comics, animations, and other media. Sonic is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies.In most games, Sonic must race through levels, collecting power-up rings and avoiding obstacles and enemies.
            Programmer Yuji Naka and artist Naoto Ohshima are generally credited with creating Sonic.Most of the games are developed by Sonic Team. The original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) was released to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario. Sonic was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa for Sonic Adventure (1998), with a more mature look designed to appeal to older players.
            Sonic is one of the world's best-known video game characters and a gaming icon. His series had sold more than 80 million copies by 2011. In 2005, Sonic was one of the first game character inductees into the Walk of Game alongside Mario, Link, and Master Chief.</p>

        <p> Sonic the Hedgehog is a fully realized character, espite a litany of issues that have preceded its release (including but not limited to: switching studios from Sony to Paramount mid-development, a complete overhaul and redesign of the titular CGI character following public outcry (mainly on Twitter and blogs, but still) just six months before it was meant to hit theaters, and a release date delayed three months), the filmmakers behind "Sonic the Hedgehog" have managed to pull together a juvenile film that is sure to delight the youngest demographic, but few others. <br><br>
            Sonic the Hedgehog first entered the public consciousness in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, eventually becoming the company's flagship property and making Sega one of the leading video game companies of the 1990s. There were talks of creating a live-action feature film as early as 1994, but that was tabled until over two decades later. And while you would think grown, adult fans would relinquish their personal grasp on the fictional character, it became brutally obvious that properties so beloved are guarded over with tooth and nail . When first look footage of the CGI Sonic released in May 2019, critics deemed the CGI Sonic was proportionally absurd - too long and lean with strangely tapering legs and, to everyone's horror, a mouth full of teeth. The claws came out and director Jeff Fowler had no real choice. Merely two days later, he announced Sonic's overhaul and complete redesign.</p>

        <p> Sonic the Hedgehog[a] is a Japanese video game series and media franchise created and owned by Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles the evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main Sonic the Hedgehog games are platformers mostly developed by Sonic Team; other games, developed by various studios, include spin-offs in the racing, fighting, party and sports genres. The franchise also incorporates printed media, animations, a 2020 feature film, and merchandise.
            The first Sonic game, released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with Nintendo's mascot Mario. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the fourth generation of video game consoles in the early 1990s. Sega Technical Institute developed the next three Sonic games, plus the spin-off Sonic Spinball (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful Saturn era, the first major 3D Sonic game, Sonic Adventure, was released in 1998 for the Dreamcast. Sega exited the console market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation systems.
            While Sonic games often have unique game mechanics and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based health system, level locales, and fast-paced gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a large cast of characters; some, such as Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, and Shadow the Hedgehog, have starred in spin-offs. The franchise has crossed over with other video game franchises in games such as Mario & Sonic, Sega All-Stars, and Super Smash Bros.
            Sonic the Hedgehog is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the bestselling video game franchises, selling over 140 million by 2016 and grossing over $6 billion as of 2020. Series sales and free-to-play mobile game downloads totaled 1.14 billion as of 2020. The Genesis Sonic games have been described as representative of the culture of the 1990s and listed among the greatest of all time. Although later games, notably the 2006 series reboot, have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality, Sonic is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture. The franchise is also known for its fandom that produces unofficial media, such as fan art and fangames.</p>

        <p> Sonic has many physical abilities like = 1.Spin Attack: Sonic curls into a ball while rolling along the ground. <br> 2.Spin Jump: A variant of Spin Dash used to attack enemies mid-jump. <br>
            3.Double Jump: Sonic performs a jump that propels him upwards while already in the air. <br> 4.Spin Dash: Sonic rolls in place to charge up, then dashes forward at high speeds rolling. <br> 5.Homing Attack: While in the air, Sonic performs a high-speed Spin Dash towards the nearest enemy. <br> 6.Light Speed Dash: A technique where Sonic moves in seemingly an instant, usually done across lines of rings. This move is, as the name implies, often described as light speed. <br> 6.Sonic Boost: Sonic envelops himself in some sort of aura and propel himself at higher speeds than normal, while acting as a sort of battering ram to enemies in front of him. <br> 7.Time Stop: An ability that stops time for 10 seconds. <br> Sonic also can transform into super forms like super sonic, hyper sonic, darkspine sonic and excalibur sonic. He can even change into non-magic forms like dark sonic, fleetway sonic and ultra sonic.

        <h2 id="Yuji-D">Yuji Naka</h2>
        <p>I was inspired by Yuji Naka to see Sonic the hedgehog because Yuji Naka is a Japanese video game programmer, designer, and producer who was the former head of Sonic Team, where he was the lead programmer of the original Sonic the Hedgehog series of games on the Sega Mega Drive. With Sonic Team, Naka also led development on games including Nights into Dreams (1996), Burning Rangers (1998), Sonic Adventure (1998), and Phantasy Star Online (2000). In 2006, he left Sega to found Prope, an independent game company. In January 2018, he joined Square Enix, where he directed Balan Wonderworld.<br><br> Naka learned how to program by replicating and debugging video game code printed in magazines. The experience prompted him to study assemblers and practice writing code during his school classes.[1] After graduating high school, Naka decided to skip university and stay in his home town. Around 1983, Naka saw that Sega was looking for programming assistants and decided to apply.[3] After a brief interview,[3] he began working for Sega in April 1984.[4] His first task was designing maps and checking floppy disks for a game titled Road Runner for the SF-7000. Naka cannot remember if the game was ever released.[4] His first major project was a game called Girl's Garden, which he and Hiroshi Kawaguchi created together as part of their training process.[3] Their boss was impressed and decided to publish the game, and it earned them notice among their peers and Japanese gamers.[1] Naka's abilities as a programmer were further demonstrated in 1987 for his work on Phantasy Star for the Master System, where he was responsible for the impressive pseudo-3D animation effects present in the game's first-person dungeons.          His true breakthrough, however, came in 1991 when he programmed the original Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Mega Drive, with Naoto Ohshima designing the characters and Hirokazu Yasuhara creating the stages. The origins of Sonic can be traced farther back to a tech demo created by Naka, who had developed an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix. Naka's original prototype was a platform game that involved a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube, and this concept was subsequently fleshed out with Oshima's character design and levels conceived by Yasuhara.[5] Following Sonic The Hedgehog's release, Naka moved to Sega's U.S. branch, Sega Technical Institute, where he worked with famed American designer Mark Cerny on the follow-up in conjunction with the original team back in Japan, now known as "Sonic Team". This partnership between the Eastern and Western teams continued through the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, though the bulk of the development duties shifted back to Sonic Team in Japan for those titles, which Naka had also returned to by that time.</p>
